          This project proposes to develop a GIS-based tool to assess, in a participatory way, the unmet transportation
          needs and mobility barriers of rural communities.
        </p>
        <p className="fs-xlg">
          The project is an open-source, participatory mapping tool aimed at rural communities, intended to guide
          development planners and policy-makers in identifying transportation needs and barriers in marginalized areas.
        </p>
        <p className="fs-xlg">
          Additionally, because the tool adapts existing mapping tools to make them more user-friendly, this project
          tackles a significant barrier (tech-literacy) to the implementation of participatory geographic information
          systems. Ultimately, the tool aims to facilitate both collecting and sharing geodata required to evaluate the
          accessibility, utilization, and sustainability of mobility options.
